# Task

In this task, you'll create a calculator that has two numbers and an operation, and the calculator will perform the operation on those two numbers.

You'll create an **integer** variable that contains the _first number_, another **integer** variable that contains the _second number_, and a third **string** variable that contains the _operation_.

Example, the two numbers could be `3` and `5`, and the operation could be `"+"`, then the calculator will add `3` and `5`, and print to the console `3 + 5 = 8`.

1. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. In `calculator.js`, create an **integer** variable for the _first number_.
3. Create a second **integer** variable for the _second number_.
4. Create a third **string** variable for the _operation_ (addition `"+"`, subtraction `"-"`, multiplication `"*"`, or division `"/"`).
5. Use `if-statements` to check which operation the third variable has.
6. Perform the mathematical operation on the two numbers, and print the result to the console.

# Submission

To submit your work, simply push your code to GitHub.

## Steps

After finishing the task and verifying your work, follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

1. Navigate to project root (where `calculator.js` is).
2. Run the command `git add .`
3. Run `git commit -m "your message here"`.
4. Push to GitHub: `git push`.
