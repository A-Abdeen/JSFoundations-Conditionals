# Task

In this task, you'll create a calculator that has two numbers and an operation, and the calculator will perform the operation on those two numbers.

You'll create an **integer** variable that contains the _first number_, another **integer** variable that contains the _second number_, and a third **string** variable that contains the _operation_.

Example, the two numbers could be `3` and `5`, and the operation could be `"+"`, then the calculator will add `3` and `5`, and print to the console `3 + 5 = 8`.

## Task Steps

1. Fork and clone [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/JSFoundations-Conditionals)
2. Open the repo folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. In `calculator.js`, create an **integer** variable for the _first number_.
4. Create a second **integer** variable for the _second number_.
5. Create a third **string** variable for the _operation_ (addition `"+"`, subtraction `"-"`, multiplication `"*"`, or division `"/"`).
6. Use `if-statements` to check which operation the third variable has.
7. Perform the mathematical operation on the two numbers, and print the result to the console.

# Submission
